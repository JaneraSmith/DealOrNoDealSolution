# DealOrNoDealSolution
This is a completed version of Deal or No Deal from an assignment from one of my Computer Science courses (Program Construction I).
This has 10 rounds with the cases being random. It is based on the actual Deal or No Deal with the calculated banker offer.
If you select "Deal", the game is over, and the accepted amount with the initial selected case amount will be displayed.
If you select "No Deal", the will continue until the final round where you select the final case that was remaining from the previous round or the initial case selected before
the game began. If either case is selected, the amount will be displayed, and the game will be over.
