# DealOrNoDealSolution
This is a completed version of Deal or No Deal from an assignment from one of my Computer Science courses (Program Construction I). This assignment was completed within a 2-week period from mid August to early September 2022. What this game is, just in case you don't know, is a game where you make money decisions to obtain the highest money value possible, while making decisions based on the banker's offer at the end of each round.

From the assignment, the player is trying to obtain $1,000,000. The game begins when the player selects a case. The amount for the player's case is not grayed out because the player doesn't know the amount.

All 26 cases have random money values. During the game, if the player decides to choose 'Deal', the player will take the banker's offer and will see what the player's initial case amount was and the game will be over. If the player chooses 'No Deal', then the player moves on to the next round while selecting the number of cases.

For the final round, the deal or no deal buttons are replaced with the initial player case selection and the final case left in play. Depending on the values left on the screen that is not grayed out, the player will have to make a decision on whether to stick with the player's initial selection or choose the case that was left in play. After selecting a case, the player will see a 'Congratulations' in the outputted textbox with the amount that the player won and the game is over.
